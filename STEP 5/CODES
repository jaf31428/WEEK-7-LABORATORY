/*Activity 4: Advanced Bulk Transactions and Concurrency Control*/
/*Step 5: Processing Bulk Transactions Safel*/

/*1.Start a bulk transaction involving multiple accounts*/
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 100 WHERE AccountID BETWEEN 1 AND 2000;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 100 WHERE AccountID BETWEEN 2001 AND 4000;
SAVEPOINT bulk_transaction;

/*2.Check balances and verify changes*/
SELECT * FROM Accounts WHERE AccountID BETWEEN 1 AND 5;

/*3.If an issue is detected, rollback partially*/
ROLLBACK TO bulk_transaction;

/*4.If everything is fine, commit*/
COMMIT;

/*5.Demonstrate concurrency control by processing transactions for multiple users simultaneously*/
SET SESSION TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
START TRANSACTION;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance - 500 WHERE AccountID = 3;
UPDATE Accounts SET Balance = Balance + 500 WHERE AccountID = 4;
COMMIT;

/*6.Verify the transaction isolation level*/
SELECT @@TRANSACTION_ISOLATION;
